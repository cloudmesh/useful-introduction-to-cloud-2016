A Paper on Container Technologies for BigData
======================================================================

Motivation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Containers are enabling new virtualization technologies. It is worth while to (a) survey container technologies (b) tools that sit on top of containers (c) see how they could or could not be supportive for big data projects.

Task
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project you will be providing a **extensive** and **high
quality** scholarly survey and review of various container
technologies and relate them to big data.  This project will be
conducted in co-authorship with Gregor von Laszewski. The document
will be using Word. References must be maintained in endnote or
Mendeley. If possible Microsoft Live will be used to share the
document. Alternatively the paper can be written in LaTeX.

THis project is not an easy project as we expect more than just a
summary, but an evaluation or guidance section that identifies
advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches. It may be
necessary to test some of the systems out.

Details will be discussed in our meetings in this project. Multiple
students can participate in the project, but responsibilities will be
clearly identified.

The authors will not plagiarize. There will be a series of meetings
with the students that select this project. We anticipate the maximum
number of students will be three. If more students sign up we may
identify a or additional topics to write an additional paper.

Example of possible useful Technologies for this Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Docker
* CoreOS
* Kubernetes
* Redhat Atomic
* Marathon
* Mesos
....

* How do storage systems and cluster technologies support this?
* Can heterogeneous systems by build?

Links

As you are a student at IU I assume you qualify for the iuware version
of endnote for the duration of your course on your private PC.

Artifacts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scholarly paper
* Report written in IEEE format in LaTeX or Word
* Original images used in the report 

* To make citation of scholarly work easier we not only recommend but
  require that you use a bibliography management tool such as
  endnote, Mendeley for word or bibtex for LaTex. In case of MS
Word, if you do not have access to endnote, please use the build in citation
  manager from Word. In case of bibtex, you can also use jabref.
  

Optional Artifacts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Samples of using the technologies identified.
