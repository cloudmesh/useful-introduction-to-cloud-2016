For the Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a meeting with Connect you may wish to ensure permissions allows access to the room and participants to speak.

- allow access: create the meeting with permissions set to allow
  anyone with the link to join.

- enabling microphone: the default setting requires participants to
  notify hosts that they wish to speak. The host then has to enable to
  microphone for all participants. Alternatively, upon creation of the
  meeting, a host can enter, go to ``Meeting ---> Preferences --->
  Audio Conference`` and check the "Allow participants to use
  Microphones" box.
