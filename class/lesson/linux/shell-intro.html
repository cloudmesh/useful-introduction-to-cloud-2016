<h1>Nelle Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#nelle-pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month
survey of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre">North Pacific
Gyre</a>, where she has
been sampling gelatinous marine life in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch">Great Pacific Garbage
Patch</a>. She
has 300 samples in all, and now needs to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Run each sample through an assay machine that will measure the
relative abundance of 300 different proteins. The machine&#8217;s output
for a single sample is a file with one line for each protein.</li>
<li>Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately using a
program her supervisor wrote called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">goostat</span></code>.</li>
<li>Compare the statistics for each protein with corresponding statistics
for each other protein using a program one of the other graduate
students wrote called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">goodiff</span></code>.</li>
<li>Write up. Her supervisor would really like her to do this by the end
of the month so that her paper can appear in an upcoming special
issue of <em>Aquatic Goo Letters</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It takes about half an hour for the assay machine to process each
sample. The good news is, it only takes two minutes to set each one up.
Since her lab has eight assay machines that she can use in parallel,
this step will &#8220;only&#8221; take about two weeks.</p>
<p>The bad news is that if she has to run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">goostat</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">goodiff</span></code> by
hand, she&#8217;ll have to enter filenames and click &#8220;OK&#8221; 45,150 times (300
runs of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">goostat</span></code>, plus 300x299/2 runs of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">goodiff</span></code>). At 30 seconds
each, that will take more than two weeks. Not only would she miss her
paper deadline, the chances of her typing all of those commands right
are practically zero.</p>
<p>The next few lessons will explore what she should do instead. More
specifically, they explain how she can use a command shell to automate
the repetitive steps in her processing pipeline so that her computer can
work 24 hours a day while she writes her paper. As a bonus, once she has
put a processing pipeline together, she will be able to use it again
whenever she collects more data.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-and-why">
<h1>What and Why<a class="headerlink" href="#what-and-why" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>At a high level, computers do four things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>run programs</li>
<li>store data</li>
<li>communicate with each other</li>
<li>interact with us</li>
</ul>
<p>They can do the last of these in many different ways, including direct
brain-computer links and speech interfaces. Since these are still in
their infancy, most of us use windows, icons, mice, and pointers. These
technologies didn&#8217;t become widespread until the 1980s, but their roots
go back to Doug Engelbart&#8217;s work in the 1960s, which you can see in what
has been called &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11JDLBXtPQ">The Mother of All
Demos</a>&#8221;.</p>
<p>Going back even further, the only way to interact with early computers
was to rewire them. But in between, from the 1950s to the 1980s, most
people used line printers. These devices only allowed input and output
of the letters, numbers, and punctuation found on a standard keyboard,
so programming languages and interfaces had to be designed around that
constraint.</p>
<p>This kind of interface is called a <strong>command-line interface</strong>, or CLI,
to distinguish it from the <strong>graphical user interface</strong>, or GUI, that
most people now use. The heart of a CLI is a <strong>read-evaluate-print
loop</strong>, or REPL: when the user types a command and then presses the
enter (or return) key, the computer reads it, executes it, and prints
its output. The user then types another command, and so on until the
user logs off.</p>
<p>This description makes it sound as though the user sends commands
directly to the computer, and the computer sends output directly to the
user. In fact, there is usually a program in between called a <strong>command
shell</strong>. What the user types goes into the shell; it figures out what
commands to run and orders the computer to execute them. Note, the
reason why the shell is called <em>the shell</em>: it encloses the operating
system in order to hide some of its complexity and make it simpler to
interact with.</p>
<p>A shell is a program like any other. What&#8217;s special about it is that its
job is to run other programs rather than to do calculations itself. The
most popular Unix shell is Bash, the Bourne Again SHell (so-called
because it&#8217;s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne &#8212; this is
what passes for wit among programmers). Bash is the default shell on
most modern implementations of Unix, and in most packages that provide
Unix-like tools for Windows.</p>
<p>Using Bash or any other shell sometimes feels more like programming than
like using a mouse. Commands are terse (often only a couple of
characters long), their names are frequently cryptic, and their output
is lines of text rather than something visual like a graph. On the other
hand, the shell allows us to combine existing tools in powerful ways
with only a few keystrokes and to set up pipelines to handle large
volumes of data automatically. In addition, the command line is often
the easiest way to interact with remote machines. As clusters and cloud
computing become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able
to drive them is becoming a necessary skill.</p>
